# Archero style

## Create room

As a starting point for all events in archero style games, you need to create a room object:
```
GameBoostSDK.CreateArcheroRoom(
  roomNumber,
  roomName,
  roomDescription,
  balance
)
```



**WIP**
- Create room (it caches hash for given room and balance)
- Send events using room object
